## FAQ

Q: What is kakeibo?

A: Kakeibo is a japanese household budgeting system. It is very similar to 'envelope budgeting', where expenses are pre-planned and budgeted in envelopes or categories. Kakeibo differs from this budgeting system by introducting retrospective reflections regarding spending. Furthermore, it reduces strictly defines categories for spending (Needs, Want, Culture and Unexpected).  

Q: Why kakeibo?

A: Most budgeting tools are either unnapproachable by novice users or do not provide specific guidance regarding budgeting. Kakeibo offers a solid middle-ground, allowing users to quickly get up and running with the system but also guiding them to better budgeting decisions through the retrospective reflections.

Q: Why Pardinus?

A: Pardinus is the specific epithet of the scientific name for the iberian lynx. This species has been revitalized throughout Portugal and Spain and stands as bastion of eco-preservation in the region. I hope in the future to support this cause with any funding this project might obtain.
